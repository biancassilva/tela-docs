Tela API provides the ability to stream responses back to a client, enabling partial results for certain requests. To achieve this, we follow the Server-Sent Events (SSE) standard. Our official Node and Python libraries include helpers to simplify parsing these events.

Streaming is supported for both the Chat Completions API and the Assistants API. This section focuses on how streaming works for Chat Completions. Learn more about how streaming works in the Assistants API [here](#).

In Python, a streaming request looks like:

```python
import tela_api

# Create a streaming chat completion request
response = tela_api.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world!"}],
    stream=True
)

# Iterate over the streamed response chunks
for chunk in response:
    print(chunk)
```
