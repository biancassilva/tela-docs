Integrating your application with our API is effortless. With the official OpenAI libraries, you can focus on building your features while the integration takes care of itself—simply update your `api_key` and `base URL` when needed.

The API can be accessed via HTTP requests from any programming language.

For Python developers, install the official library by running:

```md
pip install openai
```

To install the official Node.js library, run the following command in your Node.js project directory:

```md
npm install openai
```
